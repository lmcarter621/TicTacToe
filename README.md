# Tic Tac Toe

## How to Play
This game pits a computer against a human player.  The human player goes first and can enter a number 1-9 for the cell he wishes to place his marker, 'x'.  If the position is taken or invalid, the appropriate message will be displayed.  The user will then be asked to re-enter the input.  After the user enters valid input, the board will be displayed.  The computer will then position it's marker, 'o', for it's desired position.  The first player to get 3 in a column, diagonal, or row will be declared the winner.  In the instance that the board is full and there is no winner, a tie will be declared.
